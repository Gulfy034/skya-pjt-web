## Build and Run

1. Build & Run Preview:

   Make sure you have installed node(v18.0.0 or above) and its package manager. Clone and `cd` to the repository root, run `npm i && npm run build`. When it built successfully, run `npm run preview`, and then open a browser to access `localhost:4173`.

2. Run Dev:
  
   After `npm i && npm run dev`, and then open a browser to access `localhost:5173`.

## Notes

1. the whole website frontend part was built by vite, based on vite template "react-swc-ts".

2. do not use deno (another node package solution) because there's a issue of using SWC instead of babel.
